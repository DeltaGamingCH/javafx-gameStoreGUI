# GameStoreGUI
This repo has been created to learn creating user interfaces in Maven, JavaFx, in a very short period of time. 
This project is not expected to be continued in any way. 

## Project Functionality
Simple user interface to display video-games and purchase them, including a functional login system. 
### Login
- Allows for users to register and login
- New users are saved in the `credentials.txt` file

### User Interface
- Minimal, incomplete design, due to the little time no focus on it
- UI allows to click through games from the `primary` to the `game` page
